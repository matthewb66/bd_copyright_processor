# Black Duck Copyright Processor

# OVERVIEW

This script is provided under an OSS license (specified in the LICENSE file).

It does not represent any extension of licensed functionality of Synopsys software itself and is provided as-is, without warranty or liability.

# DESCRIPTION

This script processes an existing Black Duck project version to extract copyrights, which are filtered to remove duplicates and incorrectly identified copyrights, and export in a text format for use in a notices file.

## Installation

Clone the repo from git hub and install the dependencies listed in the requirements file
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a new file called .restconfig.json in the directory where the script is cloned to. Here are templates depending on whether you are using a username password or API token:
```
{  
 "baseurl": "https://hub-hostname",
 "username": "<username goes here>",
 "password": "<password goes here>",
 "insecure": true,
 "debug": false
 }
```
Or
```
{  
 "baseurl": "https://hub-hostname",
 "api_token": "<API token goes here>",
 "insecure": true,
 "debug": false
}
 ```
Replace the URL with the url of your BlackDuck instance and add your credentials.
